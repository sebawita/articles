# Hack for Good

<img src="./img/Hack-for-good.png?raw=true" alt="Hack for Good" width=100%/>

The Angular and NativeScript teams have teamed up to organise [Hack For Good](https://ng-ns.org/) ‚Äî an online hackathon with prizes, where all participants were asked to build mobile apps with [NativeScript Angular](https://www.nativescript.org/nativescript-is-how-you-build-native-mobile-apps-with-angular) for NGOs and in general for the good cause.


## Rules

[The rules](https://ng-ns.org/rules) were quite simple: starting from Thursday the **12th of September**, participants ‚Äî **working alone** or **in teams** of up to 4 people ‚Äî had **96 hours** to build a **Native Mobile App** ‚Äî using **NativeScript** and **Angular** ‚Äî for an **NGO** or a **Good Cause** of their choice.



## NativeScript Angular

![NativeScript + Angular](./img/nativescript-loves-angular.png?raw=true)

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) is an Open Source framework for building **truly native** mobile apps with **JavaScript**.

It allows you to use web skills, like: **TypeScript**, **Angular** and **CSS**, and get **native UI** & **performance** on **iOS** and **Android**.

## The real objective

Even though we didn't expect any of the submissions to be production-ready after 96 hours, we didn't want anyone to build an app for the sake of it. The idea was to encourage as many people out there as possible to use their skills to make a real difference to their communities and to make the world a better place.


## The spirit

Even though this was an event with cash prizes, every participant joined in with the overall do-good attitude. There were multiple cases where someone got stuck, only to receive help from someone from another team.

But even when it came to individual submissions, people were more excited about the difference they could make, than winning the prizes. Here is a message I received from one of the contestants who didn't win any of the prizes.

> You don't know how happy I was when I got your message. Winning wasn't my top priority in this contest, but doing something to help NGO is the mission!
>
> Just to let you guys know, we actually published the app to Google Play store and we received a huge compliment from the community. It's been quite a journey. The International Federation of Pedestrian (like the main organisation of pedestrian in the world) actually contacted us and asked us to translate the application to English so they can deploy it to all countries! So much joy!!!

We had a few teams that didn't manage to submit on time, but that didn't put their spirits down, as they were determined to continue working on their project. Here is an excerpt of a conversation I had with one of the participants:

> **Day 1**
>
> /> sebawita: "How is everyone doing?"
> /> wachanga: "We are learning as much as we can #TeamKenya üôÇ. Pulling an all-nighter"
>
> **Final Day**
>
> /> sebawita: "Hey, am I going to see a submission from #TeamKenya?"
> /> wachanga: "Our team didn't manage to submit, but we intend to continue working on it for the next 2 weeks"


## The numbers

This was the **1st edition** of this event.

We had **100+ participant** from **30+ different countries** and **6 different continents**, competing for **4 days**.

Everyone used **ONE Tech Stack** (**Angular** and **NativeScript**), created mobile apps for **TWO platforms** (**Android** and **iOS**) delivered with **ONE source code** for both.

We received **10+ submissions**, awarded **5 prizes**, and we consider **100% of participants as winners**.

We found that our participants represented a wide range of skills from Beginners to Advanced.


Angular Expertise :

**12% Beginners**, **48% Intermediate**, **40% Advanced**

## Winners

Picking the winners wasn't easy, as each project was great and they all deserved a big prize ü§ó

However, in order to pick the winners, we need clear criteria for us to judge all of the entries.


### Judging

Each submission was judged based on the following 3 categories:

**Innovation**

<img alt="innovation lightbulb" src="https://ng-ns.org/assets/img/innovation.svg">

How original is the idea and execution?

**Design**

<img alt="pixels and brushes" src="https://ng-ns.org/assets/img/design.svg">

How good does it look and feel to use?

**Utility**

<img alt="laptop heart" src="https://ng-ns.org/assets/img/useful.svg">

Is the app offering a service I'd use again and again?


### Announcement

The winner and the second prize have been selected based on the highest score across all 3 categories.
Additionally, we awarded the prizes for the best submissions in each category.

Stanimira Vlaeva announced the winners at Angular Connect.

Here is a more in depth overview of each winning team, their project and the good cause they set out to help. üéâ

### The Winner ‚Äî $2000

The winning submission came from **Team Alex** with the project for [Plastic Oceans UK](https://plasticoceans.uk/).

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Aceman18/ns-ng-hackathon-2019)

**From the judging panel**

This project immediately caught our eyes. It had everything we were looking for, a beautiful UI, with innovative ideas and most of all we could see using it ourselves to reduce the plastic waste and the pollution that goes with it.

**The idea:**

My project was an information/donation/tracker/map app for a charity called ‚ÄúPlastic Oceans UK‚Äù. It gave some information around the charity and plastic pollution as a whole, it allowed you to see nearby recycling stations, track your own recycling efforts and of course, donate!

**Who did you build it for?**

I chose Plastic Oceans UK one because I believe strongly in helping to protect our planet and saving marine life all over the world. Also it was a close charity to myself as I live in the UK, always good to support local charities!


### The Second Prize ‚Äî $1000

The Second Prize was awarded to the Team **Bessia** for the app that helps organise [Plogging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plogging) events.

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hateart/plogging)

<img src="./img/Second-prize-1.png?raw=true" alt="Plogging Home Page" height=400> <img src="./img/Second-prize-2.png?raw=true" alt="Plogging Home Page" height=400>

**From the judging panel**

This was project was a very close second. Yet again, we fell in love with an app that had a great balance between great looks and a very interesting initiative where you clean your community of garbage while jogging with likeminded people.

**The idea**

It is a project for people, who are keen on plogging. The application shows planned and finished events, teams and users who participated in these events and their result (total collected garbage and results by categories: metal, plastic, glass). You can see results by race, team, runner. If you authorized, you can join the event or team and watch your personal results.

**Do you plan to continue working on this project?**

I'm sure of it. Now, I have only an MVP, that can demonstrate the idea and I am going to develop the full-fledged app.

I've demonstrated this app to the participants of the Belarusian Plogging races. And they liked the idea so much.


### The Innovation Prize ‚Äî $500

The Innovation Prize was awarded to the Team **Tech4GoodPH** for their app for **Solid Waste Management** in the Philippines.

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tech4GoodPH/ng-ns-tech4goodph)

<img src="./img/Innovation-1.jpg?raw=true" alt="Innovation - Home Page" height=400> <img src="./img/Innovation-2.jpg?raw=true" alt="Innovation - Home Page" height=400> <img src="./img/Innovation-3.jpg?raw=true" alt="Innovation - Home Page" height=400>

**From the judging panel**

We liked the idea of using maps to visualise the issues with garbage waste management, and also for looking to solve the problem through a community building a solid data reports, which could be used as solid evidence to move things forward.

Although, the app is aimed at the Philippines, we can see this being used in other locations across the planet.

**The idea**

The Philippines is frequently rated as one of the least disciplined countries on garbage disposal. This leads to disasters such as flooding and landslides that further endanger millions of lives. 

Our project, Bayanihan Maps, aims to support NGOs and Local Government Units in their programs and/or policies on Solid Waste Management by enabling users to report locations that need improvement (Bad) and proper locations for garbage disposal (Good). The data that our app collects will be made open and accessible for analysis.

**Do you plan to continue working on this project?**

Yes, we do, and we already have some ideas on what we want to do next.

Future developments will encourage users to report by having some sort of gamification in the app and will also be able to generate intelligent insights by having big data analysis on the backend.

We'll also have a way to mark bad locations as "Resolved", after which the marker and rating will change.

We will also have a feature to facilitate "Clean up drives" where an organiser can specify an area in the map for the drive. The clean up drive can be "Joined" by users who want to join. There will be a "Scoring System" during a drive, and the organisers can "Add Rewards" for categories such as "Highest Score for Resolving Bad Areas" or "Highest Score for Reporting Bad Areas".

### The Design Prize ‚Äî $500

The Design Prize was awarded to the Team **William** for their shiny app helping for [TU.TO.R](https://www.tumoritoracicirari.it/).

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/williamjuan027/nsng-hackforgood)

<img src="./img/Design.gif?raw=true" alt="Design - Home Page" height=400> <img src="./img/Design.png?raw=true" alt="Design - Home Page" height=400>

**From the judging panel**

This project won the design prize, because of its great use of layouts, nice rounded corners everywhere (yay to the rounded rectangles), but importantly you don't often get to play with a menu that is fun and yet it does its job.

**The idea**

Worked on the app for patients to track their activity. Focused mainly on the user experience, experimenting with the animations in NativeScript ‚Äî check out the red sidebar on the left, and drag it to the right, and wait for a little bit, drag it again to the right to close it.

### The Utility Prize ‚Äî $500

The Utility Prize was awarded to the Team **TNS** for their practical app for [Ronald McDonald House Charities](https://rmhc.org.uk/).

*No GitHub repo*

<img src="./img/Utility-1.png?raw=true" alt="Utility - Garbage Map" height=400><img src="./img/Utility-2.png?raw=true" alt="Utility - Show Item" height=400><img src="./img/Utility-3.png?raw=true" alt="Utility - Heat Map" height=400>

**From the judging panel**

This app won the Utility prize, because of its focus on it being practical and useful. It might not be the shiniest kid on the block, but it simply does the job and it is quite extensible, as the admins of the app system can easily add new areas and tasks that the users of the app could do.

**The idea**

Our project is a kiosk app that management at the Ronald McDonald House Charities can use to sign in residents, visitors, and guests. As well as manage residents (know who is in the house or out) and daily chores (have they been completed and by who). It will help reduce the workload for management at the houses so that they can focus on continuing to improve the facilities and amenities for families that are staying there.

**Who did you build it for?**

Ronald McDonald House Charities, they supply room and board for families who have children in the local children's cancer hospital so they have a place to stay while their child is undergoing treatment.

**Do you plan to continue working on this project?**

Yes! We showed the app to our charity, and they wanted to start using it. We are working with them to improve the styling and making it easier for them to integrate with their workflow.


## Final words

Events like this demonstrate the real power of the community and the potential of how much good we can all make when we put our hearts into it.

It is good to get out of our daily jobs and use our skills for something that we all believe and make a real difference to our communities and the planet.

### We shall do it again

We have thoroughly enjoyed this event, the vibe and the apps that the participants built.

We have a lot of ideas on how to make this event better and help generate more fabulous submissions for the next time. Please stay tuned in, we will share the info on the next hackathon next year.
