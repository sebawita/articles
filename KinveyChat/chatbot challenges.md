# KinveyChat vs Common Chatbot Challenges 

![Texting](./img/communication.jpg?raw=true)

We live in times where more and more people prefer to communicate via text messaging apps than a direct call. Sure, text messaging doesn't have the same level of communication <!--(or connection)--> as a voice call, but it is also a lot simpler and more convenient.

![Chatbot](./img/chatbot.jpg?raw=true)

The change of the expectations in the communication brought in new ways of communicating with customers, which opened the doors to the chatbot technology.

<!-- Should I include any research references and stats? -->

## Benefits

The emergence of chatbots brought in a whole new set of possibilities and ways in which companies could improve customer service.

Chatbots can help reduce the common reception/call center pain points.

How many customers abandon their call with Customer Service, because they had enough of listening to the same annoying melody on a loop, whilst waiting to speak to an agent? Chatbots never get tired, so you could provide a basic/medium level of service 24/7 and without any delay. As a result you will get a lower drop out rate.

Chatbots <!--never get bored and they--> are great at handling repetitive tasks. While the chatbots take care of the most common scenarios, your agents can use their skills for more challenging requests. By relieving you agents of some of the workload, it shortens the queue for customers that want to talk to a person. 

Perhaps the most impressive feature of a chatbot is the speed of communication. Chatbots can answer questions within moments, including answers that require getting data from a database. As a result, your customers can give you 5* a lot quicker.

## The Human Question

![Robot with Human Head](./img/robot-human-head.jpg?raw=true)

One of the biggest appeals of chatbots is their likeliness to human interaction.

> Which inevitably raises the big question: 
> 
> "Should chatbots pretend to be human?"

Although our initial instinct might be to say *yes*, we should take a step back first, and think about the possible implications.

Besides the quality of the products and services, one of the biggest assets of any company/institution is their relationship with their customers.

With almost every conversation with another person, we reveal a bit of ourselves. We make an effort to be polite, we speak with respect, and to form the communication channel we build a little "bridge".

Trying to make customers believe that they are building a bridge with a machine, could be considered a betrayal of their trust. Should they realize that their efforts to build the communication bridge was a waste of time, they might feel aggravated.

> It takes years to build the reputation, and moments to lose it all.

With that picture in mind, the answer to the question: 

*"Should chatbots pretend to be human?"* is a straightforward **NO**.

However, this doesn't mean that the chatbot shouldn't mimic a human conversation. The user should be aware that they are talking to a machine, but still, be able to talk to it like to a normal person.

## Challenges

Being able to mimic a human interaction is not easy though and a lot of existing chatbots struggle with various challenges.

Let's have a look at some of the most common challenges.


### Lack of proper acknowledgments

Another important part of human-like interaction mechanism is two-way communication. When you talk to another person, often you will look for clues to see if the other person understood what you are talking about.

This is even more important when we interact with machines. So, if a conversation goes as follows:

![acknowledgments-bad](./img/conversations/acknowledgments-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to see a Dentist on Tuesday next week"
> 
> Chat: "Let me help you find an appointment"<br/>
> "What time?"

-->
You would hope that the chatbot understood two pieces of information here:

* you want to see a **Dentist**
* you want the appointment to be on **Tuesday**, but specifically on Tuesday **next week**

However, without a proper acknowledgment, you wouldn't be entirely sure if the chatbot understood everything correctly.

**Solution**:
Ensure that your chatbot communicates back the information it has identified during a conversation. Donâ€™t leave your users to guess where they are in the process.

Now a communication like this would make the user a lot more comfortable with the whole process, and they are more likely to complete the conversation:

![acknowledgments-good](./img/conversations/acknowledgments-good.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to see a Dentist on Tuesday next week"
> 
> Chat: "Let me help you book a Dentist appointment"<br/>
> "I understand that you want to come over on 5-Mar-2019."<br/>
> "What time?"
-->

### Use of Conversational UI

Some of the conversations require the user to make a choice from a limited number of options. It is usually not a good idea to make the user guess what these options are, as they might get frustrated or miss out on a choice that could be optimal for them. It is never fun when a conversation goes like this:

![conversational-UI-bad](./img/conversations/conversational-UI-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to book an appointment with Dr. Maria on Monday."
> 
> Chat: "What time?"
> 
> User: "Ideally at 11:00"
> 
> Chat: "Sorry, that slot is not available."
> 
> User: "How about 11:30?"
> 
> Chat: "Sorry, that slot is not available."
> 
> User: "This is going to take a while."
> 
> Chat: "Sorry, that slot is not available."-->

Itâ€™s always best to enable users to quickly select an option when there are a few predefined options. This can be achieved by extending the conversation mechanism with Conversational UI. This can be as simple as providing the user with a number of buttons for each available option, or even a pop-up with a list containing the items and some additional list of options.

The previous conversation could be a lot smoother with the use of Conversational UI:

![conversational-UI-good](./img/conversations/conversational-UI-good-v2.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to book an appointment with Dr. Maria on Monday."
> 
> Chat: "Here are some available slots. Select the time that works for you:"<br/>
> [12:30] [14:00] [15:30] [16:00]
> 
> User: (click) "[15:30]"
> 
> Chat: Excellent, I will book your appointment with Dr. Maria on Monday at 15:30."-->

### Fixed decision trees

Majority of chatbots today force users to navigate a decision tree built by developers. There is no way for a user to say things concerning previous steps or change his intent midway through the conversation.

In simpler words, many chatbots will only work in a very specific order: Steps: *#1 => #2 => #3*

Like this:

![fixed-decision-tree-bad](./img/conversations/fixed-decision-tree-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: Hi, I would like a ticket for Spiderman
> 
> Chat: Hi, sure I can help you get a cinema ticket.<br\>
> Which day would you like to watch a film?
> 
> User: Today
> 
> Chat: Today we have on show: [Aladdin], [Pets 2] and [Spiderman].<br/>
> Which film would you like to see?
> 
> User: Wait... What?!? ðŸ™„-->


**The Expectation:**
Allow users to provide your chatbot with the information, in the order that is convenient to them. But also allow them to change their previous answers. Then finally use prompts to guide users on the right path.

Here is how the previous conversation should be handled:

![fixed-decision-tree-good.png](./img/conversations/fixed-decision-tree-good.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "Hi, I would like a ticket for Spiderman"
> 
> Chat: "Hi, sure I can help you get a cinema ticket." <br\>
> "Which day would you like to watch Spiderman?"
> 
> User: "Today"
> 
> Chat: "Today we show Spiderman at: [6PM] and [8PM]." <br\>
> "What time would you like to watch it?"-->

### No understanding of business entities

In some cases, chatbots have no knowledge of the key entities. Instead, they treat all user input as either Text, Numbers or Dates. Making it a lot more difficult to design a constructive conversation.

Imagine talking to a receptionist in a hospital that doesn't know what doctors work there or where to find a specific treatment room. That wouldn't be very helpful, would it?

Like this:

![business-entities-bad](./img/conversations/business-entities-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to see Doctor No Such Name"
> 
> [Chatbot Understands:]<br/>
> { action: "doctor-visit", doctor: "No Such Name" }
> 
> Chat: "What time would you like to see No Such Name?"
> 
> User: "At 11am please"
> 
> [Chatbots sends a request to the backend] <br/>
> { action: "doctor-visit", doctor: "No Such Name", time: "11am" }
> 
> Chat: "OK, I've requested an appointment with Doctor No Such Name at 11am".
> 
> User: I hope this time I get to see a doctor ðŸ™„
-->
Your chatbot should be able to understand common entities such as Doctors, Offices, or Categories using natural language and return the object equivalent for these from your own business systems.

A chatbot that is aware of the key entities, can be more aware of the information provided by the user.

The previous conversation should look like this:

![business-entities-good](./img/conversations/business-entities-good1.png?raw=true)

Then once we identify the right doctor, we can provide the user with a well informed list of options.

![business-entities-good](./img/conversations/business-entities-good2.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to see Doctor No Such Name"
> 
> [Chatbot understands]<br/>
> { action: "doctor-visit", doctor: "invalid-doctor" }
> 
> Chat: "Sure, I can help you book an appointment." <br/>
> "There is no such doctor: No Such Name."
> "Would you like to see [Dr. Sebastian] or [Dr. Stefan]?"
> 
> User: "Doctor Sebastian please."
> 
> [Chatbot Understands]<br/>
> { action: "doctor-visit", doctor: "Sebastian" }
> 
> Chat: "When would you like to see Dr. Sebastian?"<br/>
> "He is available at [10:30am], [11:30am] and [12pm]."
> 
> User: 11:30am sounds good
> 
> [Chatbots sends a request to the backend] <br/>
> { action: "doctor-visit", doctor: "Sebastian", time: "11:30am" }
> 
> Chat: "OK, I've requested an appointment with Dr. Sebastian at 11:30am."
> 
> User: Great. I am sure I will get to see my doctor.
-->


### Dealing with ambiguities

The daily language we speak is full of ambiguous statements. Often you will come out from a meeting wondering whether the other person meant one thing or the opposite.

Similarly, chatbots suffer from a level of confusion with ambiguous statements. They can even get confused when multiple domain entities are used in a sentence.

For example, chatbots might get confused with statements like:

![ambiguities-bad](./img/conversations/ambiguities-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to book an appointment. Dr. Adam said that I should see Dr. Maria."
> 
> Bot: "OK, let me book you an appointment with Dr. Adam"
-->

So what do we do when we don't understand what someone else said in a meeting? ... We just wait in silence, because we don't want to be embarrassed. But what we should do - and what chatbots should also be doing - is to notify the other person/user that we are not sure what they meant exactly and ask to clarify.

This is how this conversation should look like:

![ambiguities-good](./img/conversations/ambiguities-good.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I want to book an appointment. Dr. Adam said that I should see Dr. Maria."
> 
> Bot: "I am unsure here. Which doctor would you like to see?"
> [Dr. Adam]  [Dr. Maria]
> 
> User: (click) [Dr. Maria]
> 
> Bot: "OK, let me book you an appointment with Dr. Maria"
> -->

### No long-term memory

Unlike most humans, chatbots are capable of remembering any piece of information for as long as it is needed.
However, many chatbots out there seem to treat each conversation as a conversation with a **brand new** user.

Here is an example where not using the long-term memory can get quite annoying to the users:

![long-term-memory-bad](./img/conversations/long-term-memory-bad.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I would like my usual coffee"
>
> Chat: "Welcome to Coffee With Love. What coffee would you like?" [Americano] [Latte] [Cappuccino] [Cortado]
> 
> User: (click) [Latte]
> 
> Chat: "Great, I will send you a Text Message when your coffee is ready. What is your phone number?"
> 
> User: Don't you have it. I gave it to you already 10 times
> 
> Chat: "Sorry that is an invalid format. What is your phone number?"-->

Chatbots are most suitable to automate repetitive business processes for users. The expectation is that a chatbot learns your preferences over time, and gives you an option to just confirm or update the existing info.

The previous conversation could be a lot smoother with a chatbot that knows the user:

![long-term-memory-good](./img/conversations/long-term-memory-good.png?raw=true)

<!--
> User: "I would like a coffee"
>
> Chat: "Welcome to Coffee With Love. Would you like your usual Latte?" [Yes] [No]
> 
> User: (click) [Yes]
> 
> Chat: "Great, I will send you a Text Message when your coffee is ready. Is this your number: 0123123123?"
> 
> [YES], [NO]
> 
> User: (click) [YES]
> 
> Chat: "Great, your coffee will be with you soon."-->
